    "In the previous notebook, you built a **single agent** that could take action. Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

Once all parallel tasks are complete, you can then pass their combined results to a final 'aggregator' step.\n",

He pulled out a rolled parchment, not of paper, but of some strange, resilient material. Unfurling it, Elias gasped.

Yet, a part of him, long dormant, ached for something more, a whisper of a life beyond the endless horizon. Tonight, that whisper roared.

The symbols scattered across it were unlike anything he’d ever seen – some resembled celestial bodies, others were angular and geometric, a few were flowing and organic, almost like alien calligraphy. They shimmered, not just with light, but with a subtle energy that seemed to hum against his skin. It wasn't a map of any known sea. It was a map of somewhere else entirely, a place that glowed with an invitation that resonated with the hidden yearning in his soul. He traced a particularly bright symbol, a spiral that seemed to draw his gaze inward. A tremor ran through the parchment, and for a fleeting moment, he heard the faint echo of music, a melody both ancient and new. Fear warred with an exhilarating sense of destiny. This map wasn't just showing him a place; it was calling him. The solitude he had once cherished now felt like a cage, and the glowing lines on the resilient parchment were the key. He looked out at the stormy sea, then back at the map, his heart pounding with a decision forming – a decision to finally answer a call he hadn't known he was waiting for.\n",

      "InitialWriterAgent > The Ghanaian sun beat down on the dusty road as Ama adjusted the headscarf protecting her from the relentless heat. Today was a big day. The NGO she volunteered with, \"Abena's Hope,\" was launching a new initiative to provide solar-powered water pumps to rural villages. For too long, women and children had walked miles each day for water. Abena's Hope, funded by international donors and local contributions, focused on sustainable solutions, tackling issues like access to clean water, education for girls, and small business support for women. Ama remembered her own grandmother’s arduous water journeys. Now, children could spend more time in school, and women could tend to their farms and families. A small victory, but one that promised a ripple of change across Ghana.\n",
      "CriticAgent > The story introduces a promising premise with \"Abena's Hope\" and its focus on sustainable solutions in Ghana. However, there are a few areas that could be strengthened to make it more impactful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Show, Don't Just Tell, the Impact:** While the story states that children can now spend more time in school and women can tend to their farms, it would be more engaging to *show* this. For instance, a brief scene or a more vivid description of a child enthusiastically going to school or a woman working her farm without the burden of water collection would illustrate the positive change more powerfully. Ama could witness this transformation directly, perhaps observing a group of children playing near the new pump, or hearing from a woman about how much easier her daily tasks have become.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Deepen Ama's Connection:** Ama is presented as the protagonist, but her personal connection feels slightly underdeveloped. While she recalls her grandmother's journeys, exploring her motivations for volunteering or a more specific memory that fuels her passion would add depth to her character. Perhaps a brief flashback or an internal thought about how this initiative is a personal fulfillment of a long-held dream or a promise to her past would resonate more with the reader.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Expand on \"Abena's Hope\" and its Operations:** The NGO is mentioned, but more detail about its name's origin, the \"Abena\" it's named after (if any), or a brief interaction with other NGO members could lend it more authenticity. Even a short line of dialogue about the challenges faced in setting up the initiative or a moment of collective pride among the volunteers as they launch the pumps would enrich the narrative and provide a more complete picture of the organization's work.\n",
      "RefinerAgent > The Ghanaian sun beat down on the dusty road as Ama adjusted the headscarf protecting her from the relentless heat. Today was a big day, a day that felt like a personal pilgrimage. The NGO she volunteered with, \"Abena's Hope,\" was launching a new initiative to provide solar-powered water pumps to rural villages. Ama's own grandmother, she remembered with a pang, had spent countless hours each day trekking to the river, her back aching under the weight of gourds. Ama had promised herself, as a young girl watching her grandmother’s weary return, that she would find a way to ease that burden for future generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Abena's Hope,\" funded by a mix of international donors and passionate local contributions, had been Ama's haven for the past three years. The NGO’s ethos—focusing on sustainable solutions for clean water, girls' education, and women's small business support—mirrored Ama’s own deeply held beliefs. She recalled the early days of planning, the passionate debates with co-founder, Kwabena, over logistics and funding, and the shared excitement when they finally secured the solar pump technology. \"Abena,\" Ama had explained to a curious new volunteer a few months ago, was her own mother's name, a woman who had instilled in her the importance of community and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Ama surveyed the small crowd gathered around the newly installed pump, her heart swelled. A young girl, no older than eight, giggled as she turned the handle, water gushing out. Ama recognized her – Nana, whose mother, Akosua, had tearfully explained just last week how Nana, her eldest, would often miss school to help fetch water. Today, Nana’s school uniform was bright and clean. Later, Ama saw Akosua heading towards her small plot of land, a hoe slung over her shoulder, a confident stride replacing the weariness Ama had grown accustomed to seeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A small victory, but a significant one,\" Kwabena said, clapping Ama on the shoulder. \"This is what Abena’s Hope is all about. Seeing the change firsthand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ama smiled, the warmth of the sun on her face a welcome contrast to the emotional warmth spreading through her. This was more than just providing water; it was about reclaiming time, enabling education, and nurturing dreams. It was a ripple of change, and she was incredibly proud to be a part of it.\n",
